Graphmaker version 1.0.0  is a free software which is developed by
Kian William Nowrouzian. 
It is a package including both component, module and plugin.
Both component in site part and module use content plugin, so without it,
it will not work, plugin will be enabled automatically from Joomla backend,
yet check it after upload. After installation is complete you may create category(ies) and
place graphs under these categories, to view graph from category(ies) menu in case there is not
a menuitem, create a menu with a graph menuitem to have a path for that graph, but do not assign 
a module for that menu if you do not need a direct menuitem for that graph. When you view the graph move the cursor over graph to view the svg effects.
In the future upgrade I shall add different types of graphs so that there will be more alternatives, also the ability
to place lots of modules in the same page. Remember the search engine under category(ies) menuitem does not work, it will
in the future upgrades, I could  have removed it but I did not because of the future upgrades.
The license is GNU/GPLv3.
It is written for joomla 3.x.
